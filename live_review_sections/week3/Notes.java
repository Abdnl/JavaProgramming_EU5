Week3 Java Review:
		1. Switch statements
		2. Loops
		3. Branching statements
		4. Methods
		


Switch statement:
	
boolean : equal, not equal, greater, less, . etc

	syntax:
		switch(expression){ // MUST be evaluated to single value

			case caseValue1: 
				statementA;
				break;   // for exiting the siwtch

			case caseValue2:
				statemementB;
				break;

			...

			default:
					statmentC;					

		}

		SWITCH does not accept: boolean, double, float, long

		caseValue MUST match with switch statements' expression

		caseValue MUST be unique

		whichever case matches, gets executed first

		dfeault block gets executed if none of the cases are matching


	number: 1~12

	28 days: 2
	30 days: 4, 6, 9, 11
	31 days: 1,3,5,7,8,10,12
	invalid Days: less than 1 or greaters than 12


Loops: repeated actions
		 for loop, while loop, do-while loop

		 for loop: only gets executed if the condition is true

		 		for(initialization; Condition; Iteration ){
		 				statement
		 		}

		 		initialization: starting point

		 					i = 1;

				Condition: ending point, created based on initialization

							i <= 5

				Iteration: co-related to the condition. MUST be capable enough to make the condition false


		while loop: repeated if statement
				while(Condition){ // true
					statementA; // gets executed multiple times
				}


				if(Condition){ // true
					statementB;  // only gets executed one time
				}

		do-while loop:
